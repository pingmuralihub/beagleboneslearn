# Build image with "python,pip & openssh"
1. openssh is already installed because I used " bitbake core-image-full-cmdline ", command but the weblink used " bitbake core-image-minimal "
2. change the working dir by -> cd /home/murali/yactotut/poky
3. Then execute -> source oe-init-build-env
4. After executing previous command it will automatically redirect to /home/murali/yactotut/poky/build folder
5. Insert the following lines at end of the local.conf -> vim conf/local.conf -> 
   IMAGE_INSTALL:append = "openssh \
                           python3 \
                           python3-pip"

6. Then enter the "bitbake core-image-full-cmdline" command.
7. go to the image directory -> /home/murali/yactotut/sources/tmp/deploy/images/beaglebone-yocto
8. Check the usb memory card device address by -> " lsblk " command-> for me it shows "sde"
9. then execute the command "sudo dd if=core-image-full-cmdline-beaglebone-yocto.wic of=/dev/sde bs=4M"
10. then remove the sd card and bootwith SD card by pressing button s2
11. After login tried to install  pip3.10 install numpy, due to time mismatch it didn't install
12. change the time by -> date -s '2025-04-01 06:00:10' 
13. after that intalled numpy successfully.
14. tested python with simple print program and executed by ->  python3.10 hello.py

# Queries
1. I tried to install ntp server -> but beaglebone didn't support apt ->
   sudo apt-get install ntp
   sudo systemctl enable ntpd
   sudo systemctl start ntpd
2. checked with help apt -> no response -> so next build image add the apt build
3. how to use apt commands in beaglebone
