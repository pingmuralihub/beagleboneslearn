# queries
1. i've booted with Beaglebone mini usb cable, but usb is not configured why?
2. there are two wic files with same file size why? need to check in future.
   a. core-image-full-cmdline-beaglebone-yocto.wic
   b. core-image-full-cmdline-beaglebone-yocto-20250326201604.rootfs.wic


# comparition with debianarm linux with linardo
1. yocto automatically generate mlo,umage,zimage, dtb files by itself with core-image-full-cmdline-beaglebone-yocto.wic
2. And also uEnv.txt is not needed, because this also automatically generaed by the core-image-full-cmdline-beaglebone-yocto.wic
